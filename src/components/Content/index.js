          This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It
          accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what
          amount of the available space inside the flex container the item
          should take up. If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining
          space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If
          one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take
          up twice as much space as the others (or it will try to, at least).
